# DTek Mini Project
This is a small project in the course Computer science and components at KTH, in which students are to develop a small hardware-near program which runs on a microchip.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to create a simple space invaders like game, which runs on a Uno32 Board and is displayed and controlled through the ChipKit I/O shield. 

### Features
The fundamental requirements for the game is:
* A moveable player character
* Different enemies that attack the player 
* The player can shoot and kill the enemies
* The player loses if all lives are lost

Some extra features that are implemented:
* Different difficulties
* Bosses that must be defeated in order to continue
* A score system where points are collected depending on how long the player survives and how many bosses and enemies are killed. 
* High score board, displaying the best score

### Prerequisites 
The code is developed for a Uno32 Board with ChipKit I/O shield. MCB32 toolchain, which is a c-compiler and assembler for the Uno32 boards, is needed too.
